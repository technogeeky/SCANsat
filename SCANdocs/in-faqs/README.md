  * What does SCANsat do?
    * It allows you to scan planetary bodies for terrain, biome, and resource information and generate various kinds of maps.
  * How does SCANsat affect gameplay?
    * It allows you to see surface details from orbit from an interactive, zoom-able map. This will help you plan your missions (for example, landing near a divider between two or three biomes) and provide critical information you need to attempt a safe landing (for instance, the slope map will help you avoid treacherous hills)
  * Will this version break my existing scans from older versions of SCANsat?
    * **No!** This version is completely backwards compatible, and you current scanning state (which is stored in persistent.sfs) will be safe and sound. Nevertheless, you should make a backup copy of your game before upgading any mod.
  * Do I need to attach a part to my vessel to use SCANsat?
    * **No, but...**. You can view existing maps from any vessel, but you need to attach a scanner to add new data to the maps.
  * [Career Mode] Does SCANsat give us science points?
    * **Yes!** For each type of map, if you scan at least 30% of the surface, you can yse Data for partial science points; up until the maximum value at 95% map coverage.
  * [Career Mode] Is it integrated into the tech tree?
    * **Yes!** This link tells you which nodes unlock which parts in the tech tree.
  * [Contracts] Does SCANsat offer contracts to complete?
    * **No.** This is a planned feature.
  * Can you add <some feature or change> to SCANsat?
    * **Probably!** First, check the issues page to see if it's already been requested. If not, add a new issue. Even better, attempt to add the feature yourself and submit a pull request. We'll catch the bugs for you!
