[*]What does SCANsat do?
[LIST]
[*]It allows you to [B][I]scan[/I][/B] and [B][I]generate[/I][/B] various kinds of maps (currently: [B]low-[/B] and [B]high-resolution altimetry[/B], and [B]a biome map[/B]) for each planetary body.

[*]How does SCANsat affect gameplay?
[LIST]
[*][spoiler=Answer]It allows you to see surface details from orbit from an [B]interactive[/B], [B]zoom-able map[/B].   This will help you plan your missions (for example, landing near a   divider between two or three biomes) and provide critical information   you need to attempt a safe landing (for instance, the [B]slope map[/B] will help you avoid treacherous hills)[/spoiler]

[*]Do I need to attach a part to my vessel to use SCANsat?
[LIST]
[*][spoiler=Yes! (more)]Currently, [B]yes[/B]. You should attach at least one SCANsat part to each vessel (use the [B]MapTraq[/B] part to view only without scanning).[/spoiler] 
[*][spoiler=No! (more)]In the future, we may use ModuleManager to add scanning to [B]all[/B] cockpits and probe cores (and you can easily do this yourself, now).[/spoiler]
