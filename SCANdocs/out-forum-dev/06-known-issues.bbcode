[*][B][INCOMPLETE] [/B]v7.0rc0  does not include scanners with the ORS or Kethane scanning  functionality, yet. Use the included ModuleManager configs to try them  out. 
[*][B][BUG] v6.0[/B]   includes Big Map Caching.  Sometimes it is necessary to resize the big   map (click the [//] button  and drag a little bit) to reset the cache.
